# Group7ProjectCode
myApplication.py contains the code for the main application. It is run with python 3, not python 2.
Dockerfile.armhf is included, since it was edited during the project for two purposes: compatibility with python 3, and usage of the scipy module.
The files are supposed to be used with the rest of the files in opendlv-tutorial-kiwi/image-postprocessing-opencv,
in the fahion indicated in the tutorial instructions.
